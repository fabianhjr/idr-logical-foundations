# CLA/Copyright Transfer

  In order to keep the legalities simple and to have a single point of
responsibility in case the need should ever arise to adjust the license terms,
sublicense, etc., we ask all contributors to assign copyright in their
contributions to the appropriate "author of record," as follows:

>   I hereby assign copyright in my past and future contributions to the Logical
> Foundations in Idris project to the Author of Record. I understand that, at
> present, the Author of Record is Fabi√°n Heredia.

Include this statement your a commit in your pull/merge request and digitally
sign your commits. (If you didn't include it, you can use `git commit --amend
-S` to change the message)
