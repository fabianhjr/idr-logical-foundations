# Logical Foundations in Idris

  This is a translation of Logical Foundations in Coq by Benjamin C. Pierce et
al. It might also use Software Foundations in Idris (2016) as a reference.

# Requirements

 - Make  (Optional)
 - Idris
 - Pandoc

# Building

  Just `make` and it will typecheck and create a PDF file from the sources in
`book/`. You can safely ignore the `aux/` directory.

# Solving Exercies

  **Important**: Per Benjamin C. Pierce request, do not post your solutions in a
public medium. (Including GitHub/GitLab/etc)

  Just replace the type holes (`?type_hole`) for your solutions and run either
`make` or `make test` to run the typechecker.
