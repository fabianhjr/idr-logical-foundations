= Preface {.unnumbered}

== Welcome

  This is the entry point in a series of textbooks on various aspects of
Software Foundations --- the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.
Topics in the series include basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem
proving, the Idris proof assistant, functional programming, operational
semantics, logics for reasoning about programs, and static type systems. The
exposition is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced
undergraduates to PhD students and researchers. No specific background in logic
or programming languages is assumed, though a degree of mathematical maturity
will be helpful.

  The principal novelty of the series is that it is one hundred percent
formalized and machine-checked: each text is literally a program for Idris. The
books are intended to be read alongside (or inside) an interative session with
Idris. All the details in the text are fully formalized in Idris, and most of
the exercises are designed to be worked using Idris.

  The files in each book are organized into a sequence of core chapters,
covering about one semester's worth of material and organized into a coherent
linear narrative, plus a member of "offshoot" chapters covering additional
topics. All the core chapters are suitable for both upper-level undergraduates
and graduate students.

  This book, _Logical Foundations_, lays groundwork for the others, introducing
the reader to the basic ideas of functional programming, constructive logic, and
the Idris proof assistant.

== Overview

  Building reliable software is really hard. The scale and complexity of modern
systems, the number of people involved, and the range of demands placed on them
make it extremly difficult to build software that is even more-or-less correct,
much less 100% correct. At the same time, the increasing degree to which
information processing is woven into every aspect of society greatly amplifies
the cost of bugs and insecurities.

  Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to these challenges
by developing a whole host of techniques for improving software reliability,
ranging from recommendations about managing software projects teams (e.g.,
extreme programming) to design philosophies for libraries (e.g.,
model-view-controller, publish-subscribe, etc.) and programming languages (e.g.,
object-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, functional
programming, ...) to mathematical techniques for specifying and reasoning about
properties of software and tools for helping validate these properties. The
_Software Foundations_ series is focused on this last set of techniques.

  The text is constructed around three conceptual threads:

  1. basic tools from _logic_ for making and justifying precise claims about
     programs;
  2. the use of _proof assistants_ to construct rigorous logical arguments;
  3. _functional programming_, both as a method of programming that simplifies
     reasoning about programs and as a bridge between programming and logic.

  Some suggestions for further reading can be found in the
[Postscript](#postscript) chapter. Bibliographic information for all cited works
can be found in the [Bibliography](#bibliography) chapter.

=== Logic

  Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is proofs --- unassailable
arguments for the truth of particular propositions. Volumes have been written
about the central role of logic in computer science. Manna and Waldinger called
it "the calculus of computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper _On the
Unusual Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science_ catalogs scores of ways in
which logic offers critical tools and insights. Indeed, they observe that:

 > As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to be significantly more effective
 > in computer science than it has been in mathematics. This is quite
 > remarkable, especially since much of the impetus for the development of logic
 > during the past one hundred years came from mathematics.

  In particular, the fundamental tools of _inductive proof_ are ubiquitous in
all of computer science. You have surely seen them before, perhaps in a course
on discrete math or analysis of algorithms, but in this course we will examine
them more deeply than you have probably done so far.

=== Proof Assistants

  The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
unidirectional: CS has also made important contributions to logic. One of these
has been the development of software tools for helping construct proofs of
logical propositions. These tools fall into two broad categories:

  - _Automated theorem provers_ provide "push-button" operation: you give them
    a proposition and they return either _true_ or _false_ (or, sometimes,
    _don't know: ran out of time_). Although their capabilities are still
    limited to specific domains, they have matured tremendously in recent years
    and are used now in a multitude of settings. Examples of such tools include
    SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.
  - _Proof assistants_ are hybrid tools that automate the more routine aspects
    of building proofs while depending on human guidance for more difficult
    aspects. Widely used proof assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2,
    PVS, and Coq, among many others.

  This course is based around Idris, a general programming language and proof
assistant that has been under development since 2009. Idris provides a rich
environment for interactive development of machine-checked programs.

=== Functional Programming

  The term _functional programming_ refers both to a collection of programming
idioms that can be used in almost any programming language and to a family of
programming languages designed to emphasize these idioms, including Haskell,
OCaml, Standard ML, F#, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, and
Coq.

  Functional programming has been developed over many decades --- indeed, its
roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was invented in the 1930s, well
before the first computers (at least the first electronic ones)! But since the
early '90s it has enjoyed a surge of interest among industrial engineers and
language designers, playing a key role in high-value systems at companies like
Jane St. Capital, Microsoft, Facebook, and Ericsson.

  The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as possible,
computation should be pure, in the sense that the only effect of execution
should be to produce a result: it should be free from _side effects_ such as
I/O, assignments to mutable variables, redirecting pointers, etc. For example,
whereas an _imperative_ sorting function might take a list of numbers and
rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a pure sorting function would
take the original list and return a _new_ list containing the same numbers in
sorted order.

  A significant benefit of this style of programming is that it makes programs
easier to understand and reason about. If every operation on a data structure
yields a new data structure, leaving the old one intact, then there is no need
to worry about how that structure is being shared and whether a change by one
part of the program might break an invariant that another part of the program
relies on. These considerations are particularly critical in concurrent systems,
where every piece of mutable state that is shared between threads is a potential
source of pernicious bugs. Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in
functional programming in industry is due to its simpler behavior in the
presence of concurrency.

  Another reason for the current excitement about functional programming is
related to the first: functional programs are often much easier to parallelize
than their imperative counterparts. If running a computation has no effect other
than producing a result, then it does not matter _where_ it is run. Similarly,
if a data structure is never modified destructively, then it can be copied
freely, across cores or across the network. Indeed, the "Map-Reduce" idiom,
which lies at the heart of massively distributed query processors like Hadoop
and is used by Google to index the entire web is a classic example of functional
programming.

  For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet another
significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between logic and computer
science. Indeed, Idris itself can be viewed as a combination of an extremely
expressive functional programming language plus a set of tools for stating and
proving logical assertions. Moreover, when we come to look more closely, we find
that these two sides of Idris are actually aspects of the very same underlying
machinery â€” i.e., _proofs are programs_.

=== Further Reading

  This text is intended to be self contained, but readers looking for a deeper
treatment of particular topics will find some suggestions for further reading in
the [Postscript](#postscript) chapter.

== Practicalities

  <!--- TODO: Missing Chapter Dependencies -->

=== System Requirements

  Idris runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. You will need:

  - A current installation of Idris, available from the
    [Idris home page](http://idris-lang.org/). These files have been tested
    with Idris 1.3.0.
  - An editor with integrations for Idris. (E.g. Atom, Emacs, or Vim) You might
    want to become acquainted with their [interactive editing] features.

=== Exercises

   Each chapter includes numerous exercises. Each is marked with a "star
rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

  - One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text and that, for
    most readers, should take only a minute or two. Get in the habit of working
    these as you reach them.
  - Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).
  - Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten minutes to half an
    hour).
  - Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour and up).

  Also, some exercises are marked "advanced," and some are marked "optional."
Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises should provide good coverage
of the core material. Optional exercises provide a bit of extra practice with
key concepts and introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
readers. Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra challenge and a
deeper cut at the material.

  **Please do not post solutions to the exercises in a public place.** Software
Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for university courses.
Having solutions easily available makes it much less useful for courses, which
typically have graded homework assignments. We especially request that readers
not post solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by search
engines.

=== Downloading the Idris Files

  <!--- TODO: Missing Repo -->

  (If you are using the book as part of a class, your professor may give you
access to a locally modified version of the files, which you should use instead
of the release version.)

== Note for Instructors

  If you plan to use these materials in your own course, you will undoubtedly
find things you'd like to change, improve, or add. Your contributions are
welcome!
